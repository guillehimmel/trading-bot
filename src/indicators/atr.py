"""
Average True Range (ATR) indicator.

ATR measures market volatility by calculating the average of true ranges.
Higher ATR indicates higher volatility, lower ATR indicates lower volatility.

Algorithm:
    True Range (TR) = max(high-low, |high-prev_close|, |low-prev_close|)

    This implementation uses Wilder's Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA) for the
    ATR calculation, which is the standard method. Wilder's smoothing uses
    alpha = 1/period rather than standard EMA's alpha = 2/(period+1).

    Wilder's SMMA formula:
        SMMA(i) = ((SMMA(i-1) * (period - 1)) + current_TR) / period

    This is equivalent to EWM with alpha = 1/period, providing a smoother
    result than standard EMA and matching the original formula from Welles
    Wilder's 1978 book "New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems".

Uses:
    - Position sizing: Higher ATR = smaller position (volatility-adjusted)
    - Stop-loss placement: Stop at entry - (ATR * multiplier)
    - Take-profit placement: Target at entry + (ATR * multiplier)
    - Trailing stop distance: Trail by ATR * multiplier
    - Volatility filtering: Avoid trades during extreme volatility

Volatility Classification:
    Based on percentile ranking of current ATR vs recent history:
    - Low (<25th percentile): Quiet market, larger positions
    - Normal (25th-75th percentile): Standard conditions
    - High (75th-90th percentile): Elevated volatility, smaller positions
    - Extreme (>90th percentile): Crisis conditions, minimal exposure

Parameters:
    - period: 14 (Wilder's original recommendation)

Integration:
    Used by SignalScorer for volatility assessment. Also used by runner.py
    for ATR-based trailing stops and hard stops.
